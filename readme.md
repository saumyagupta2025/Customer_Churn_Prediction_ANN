# Customer Churn Prediction with Artificial Neural Network

## Overview
This project utilizes an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customer churn. The goal is to identify whether a customer is likely to leave or stay with the company based on various input features. The model is implemented using TensorFlow's Keras API and is designed for binary classification tasks.

## Features
* **Artificial Neural Network (ANN):** A deep learning model comprising input, hidden, and output layers.
* **Binary Classification:** Classifies customers into two categories: churn (exit) or no churn (stay).
* **Data Preprocessing:** Includes feature encoding and normalization to prepare data for training.
* **Model Evaluation:** Performance metrics include accuracy and confusion matrix to assess the model's effectiveness.

## Model Architecture
* **Input Layer:** Accepts input features.
* **Hidden Layers:** Two hidden layers with ReLU activation functions to capture complex patterns.
* **Output Layer:** A single neuron with a sigmoid activation function to output probabilities for binary classification.

## Performance
The model is evaluated based on accuracy (86%) and confusion matrix, providing insights into its ability to predict customer churn effectively.
